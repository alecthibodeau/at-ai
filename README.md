# Nona AI

## A user interface for Google Gemini Nano

Nona AI is a user interface I built that connects your local machine to Google's Gemini Nano for Chrome. Make prompts to Gemini Nano via Nona AI and receive responses, similar to other large langage model (LLM) interfaces.

After setting up everything you can run this project completely offline with no internet signal. As of this writing you will need to install and use Google's Chrome Dev browser on your machine to connect to Gemini Nano.

Before starting please review Google's [Built-in AI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in) description, particularly the text at bottom reading "When to use built-in AI." Take the following steps to set up your machine and run Nona AI locally through a Vite React server.

### Steps to get Nona AI running on your machineâ€¦

1) Install or update [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
2) Install the [Chrome Dev browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev).
3) Enable Chrome Dev to connect to Gemini Nano: Follow the steps [here](https://ai-sdk-chrome-ai.vercel.app), specifically the three numbered ones in "Necessary Experimental Flags."
4) Clone this repository to your machine
5) On your machine navigate to where'd you've cloned this repository.
6) Install dependencies: In your local console run `npm install`
7) Run Nona AI: In your local console run `npm run dev`
8) In your Chrome Dev browser navigate to `localhost:5173`
9) Enjoy! (And check back here for project updates.)
